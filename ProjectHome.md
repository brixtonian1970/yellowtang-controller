Some of this project description can be found in French here : http://wismie.wordpress.com

The idea is to create from scratch an aquarium controller with an Arduino Mega core (in this case).

This should include in the future sensors, lights management with relays, temp control, real time clock, data logging etc.

As for the project name, a yellow tang is a common fish in reef aquarias, so I thought it would be a nice name for a controller ;)
